# mastering-go-summary

It's a repo to gather and store useful notes that there are in the Masterin go book.
I'm going to write here just small notes that need to remember for later or some pieces of code to review and remember structure.
This is not a replace for book and the book has its own appointment to read an learn and it's just a brief summary.
