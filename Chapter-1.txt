Go does not care about the name of the source file of an autonomous program
as long as the package name is main and there is a single main() function in it, because the
main() function is where the program execution begins. As a result, you cannot have
multiple main() functions in the files of a single project.

$ go build aSourceFile.go

After this command run, you will have a new executable file named aSourceFile
The main reason that aSourceFile is that big is because it is statically linked, which means
that it does not require any external libraries in order to run.

$ go run aSourceFile.go

With go run, the Go compiler still needs to create an executable file. The
fact that you will not see it, that it is automatically executed, and that it is
automatically deleted after the program has finished might make you
think that there is no need for an executable file!
